            <div class="hero-description    ">
                <p>Hello, my name is Ruben Gutierrez & I am a website designer in La Habra, California. My interest in technology began when I received my first computer at 8 years old and has steadily progressed to where I'm at today, building and designing websites. One of the things I enjoy most about working with these tools is helping others progress and solve problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                When Iâ€™m not in front of the computer making websites I enjoy hanging out with my friends and taking hikes in the beautiful hills of Southern California.

            <p>One way I enjoy helping others is by designing websites like these in a program called "Figma" and offering them for free so that other designers can learn from them.</p>
