    <h1>About Me: Ruben Gutierrez</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Ruben Gutierrez & I am a website designer in La Habra, California. My interest in technology began when I received my first computer at 8 years old and has steadily progressed to where I'm at today, building and designing websites. One of the things I enjoy most about working with these tools is helping others progress and solve problems.</p>
    <p>When Iâ€™m not in front of the computer making websites I enjoy hanging out with my friends and taking hikes in the beautiful hills of Southern California.</p>
