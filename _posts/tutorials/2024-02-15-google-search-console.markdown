## What is Google Search Console?
<a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/" target="_blank">**Google Search Console**</a> - Is a program that Google created for website owners so that they can see data about how their website/webpages are doing in Google's search results. Google Search Console can help you analyze and keep track of a lot of useful information. 

This information can help you create better content so that you can get more web traffic to your website. Some of that information includes things like the search queries your website is appearing for, the positions your webpages are ranked, if your pages are even in the search results, and so much more. Google Search Console is a vital part of any SEO campaigns and familiarizing yourself with it should a priority if you want your website to rank high in the search result.

## What is Crawling/Crawl Requests for Search Engines?

This process takes a lot of factors into consideration some of which are pretty well known and others that Google doesn't really let anyone know about. Generally speaking if the page you're trying to get listed in Google's search results are well written, are a decent length, and have some informative and useful content then Google will most likely index it.

## What Is Search Engine Ranking?
While ranking may not be a step in actually getting your website listed in Google search results it's important that you know about it so that you can progress in your search engine optimization efforts. Ranking is how Google determines what position your page appears in. The more relevant and useful information on a page is the higher it ranks in search results. Keep in mind that their are also a lot of other factors that determine a pages position in the search engine.

## Another Thing To Keep In Mind About Google

Even if your page has a minimal amount of content Google will eventually find it and list in their search results.
