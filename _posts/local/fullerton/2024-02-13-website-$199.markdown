Hello, my name is Ruben, I've been designing and building websites for a few years & I'd like to help.

## The Cost of A Website
Starting a website can be a bit expensive. Theirs a lot of factors that determine the total cost of setting one up. Below you'll find a general estimate.

Here is the cost to start a website:

Domain: **$7 - $100** A Year

Hosting: **$5 - $20** A Month

Designer: **$30 - $40** An Hour

So you're looking at about **~$100** a year just for the basic requirements. Then you have to factor in the cost of hiring a website designer to make it look exactly like you want it to.  

### The Different Options For Building A Website (Wix, WordPress)

Theirs a ton of options out there to help you build your website. You don't always have to go the traditional route of purchasing your own domain name, hosting and setting everything up yourself. Site builder tools like Wix and WordPress bring all of those factors into an easy to use interface that provides novice internet users with convenient tools to build a website for a monthly subscription.    

### The Cost of Wix & WordPress Subscriptions

While Wix is a convenient options for building a websites it can still be a bit costly if youâ€™re not looking to invest a ton of money and time.
