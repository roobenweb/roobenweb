### My Goals As A Website Designer in the Los Angeles, California Area.
When I began my journey to become a website designer all I really wanted to do was to make money using my interest in technology. Now that I've gotten a bit older I've come to understand a little more about the world and how I want to make it better. One thing I've noticed is that theirs a lot of people around me that don't understand how beneficial these communication tools can be. My goal is to help more people around me get online so that they can find new opportunities.

Take this example for instance. When I first began learning about these things I didn't really understand what I was getting into. The only thing I knew was that I enjoyed being able to solve problems using computers and their was some decent money in doing so. The more I experimented with web design the more I began to realize how effective it could be. One of the first websites I made landed me a few high end clients and a couple of really good job opportunities. The fact that people came searching for me offering me a different path amazed me!

**Remember** You don't need a store or to even have a business to benefit from a website. Anybody looking to make progress in their careers and goals should use a website to get ahead.

Investing a bit of time and money into a website can have profound effects on a persons life.  Websites allow for people from all over the world and all walks of life to get to know you. They can open a door that you might have never known about otherwise, the opportunities are endless!.
