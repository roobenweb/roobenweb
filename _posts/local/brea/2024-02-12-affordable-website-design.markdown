Are you looking for an affordable website solution in the Brea, California area?  

Hello my name is Ruben, I've been working on websites for a few years & I'd like to help you create the website you truly want.

A lot of people make the assumption that you need a ton of money to start a website.  And yes, pouring a lot of money into a website will get you some return on your investment it doesn't have to cost you an arm and a leg when you work with me!

## Why Having A Website Is Important

Having a website is an important aspect of owning a business. 

A website not only provides you with tools to manage and market your business but it's also the first impressions potential customers get from you.

### The cost of running a website
As a small business owner or someone looking to make a personal website you don't always want to invest a ton of time and money.

### What You Get With Me You Won't Get From A SiteBuilder
Site building tools are awesome you pay a few bucks a month and you get access to a lot of tools to help you easily build a website. 

While these tools are amazing they do pose a problem for people who are looking to stand out online. Website building tools have a reputation of being limited in their designs.  They tools they offer for building sites eventually make a lot of them look the same.

The difference you get with me compared to site building tools like Wix or WordPress is that you get a one of a kind website design that you nobody else will have.
