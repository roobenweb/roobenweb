Today I worked on making my website more mobile friendly. 

One of the things that I've neglected while writing content and building out the structure for my website is its design.

So far I've sprinkled a few media queries to make the my home and blog
pages fit in to mobile devices but eventually I'll go back and write a
@mixin to clean up the code in my SCSS/CSS file.

Another one of my goals today is to write more local SEO content for my web design services.

My goal is try to cover as many relevant keywords as possible. I've noticed that a lot of the keywords I'm aiming to rank for are pretty easy to compete with.
