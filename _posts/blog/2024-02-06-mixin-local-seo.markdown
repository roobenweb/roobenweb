Today I worked on making my website more mobile friendly. 

One of the things that I've neglected while writing content and coding out the structure of my website is its design.

## How I'm Making My Website More Mobile Friendly
So far I've written more media queries so that elements resize properly and fit inside of the browser on different types of devices. Later on when I have some time I'll go back and implement a few mixins to clean up the SCSS so that it doesn't become a problem in the future.

## Future Plans For My Website
Another thing I'm also focusing on is writing more local content for my website. One of the fundamentals lesson about search engines optimization that I've learned is that if you don't have the keywords you want your website to rank for then don't be surprised when they don't. 

My goal is to add some pages with keywords that are relevant to the La Habra, California area so that I can work with more people around me.

Before I start writing I usually take the time to look up the keyword I'm aiming to rank for so that I can analyze the competition to see what I'm up against. In this case I'm up against a lot of content that's been copied and pasted.
