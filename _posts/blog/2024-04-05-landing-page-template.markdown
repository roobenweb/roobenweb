I finally finished this <a href="/projects/" target="_blank"> landing page template</a> I've had been working on for the last couple of weeks.

## Some of the Features on This Landing Page Include
Below are some of the features I decided to incorporate in the landing page.

- Carousel Animation
- Features Section
- Formspree Contact Section


### New Focus
I spent some time thinking of what I'm going to be doing next.

I think I'm going to be making an interactive calculator app.

I got the idea from watching AI content explode in popularity in the past
couple of years.
