Something I'm trying to improve on as an online marketer is writing more. In the past I've created a lot of websites & web projects but I never end up posting about them.. Now that I'm getting a little more serious about web design I've started realizing the benefits so here it is.

## Improving My Websites Design
The goal for today was to improve my websites design.

My site started out pretty basic and now it's looking better and everyday. Now that I mention it I'm probably going to start taking screenshots every other day to post them here to give better updates so stick around if you want to see that. 

The main things I worked on today was reducing the code in the layouts and CSS.

Sometimes when I get into the zone I start building things out recklessly because I enjoy seeing progress in the browser. Things like clean code and ease of use got by the waist side. Eventually on days like today I take the time to go back and clean the code to make it more practical and easy to read.

## Creating Free Design Resources in Figma
Another thing I'm working on is getting some traffic going for my website. In order to drive traffic to my website I've been designing websites and apps in Figma and offering them as free templates. 

Once I'm finished making one I publish it to my community profile so that other designers can get a copy of the original file.

So far it's been going pretty well I've gotten hundreds of views and duplications in just two weeks. I also feel like I'm giving back to the design community because I've learned a lot from free templates in the past and they've made me a better designer.

### Plans For Tomorrow 

Tomorrow I'm going to write more content. The goal is going to be to write something more informative like a tutorial.  Whatever it is I'll try to summarize it by the end of the night. 

Another idea that came to mind earlier today was o creating a JavaScript website cost calculator.  I've made one in the past but stupidly erased it. I think it'll be a very useful tool that a lot of people will find interesting and useful.
