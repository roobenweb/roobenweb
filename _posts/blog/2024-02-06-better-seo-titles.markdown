It's March, spring is around the corner and I'm busy tapping away on my keyboard trying to improve my website.  

## What I'm Doing To Improve My Websites Titles
I've been doing a lot of research on the way people read information online and I've learned a few interested things about the way people read information online. One thing I've learned is that the majority of people online don't read everything on the page. 

What most people do when they look at a page is scan the page looking for words and information they are familiar with.

This leads me to my next piece of advice when you're writing headlines for your websites content.

Titles should be descriptive but not too long. Under 200 Characters seems to be the guideline.
