It's March, spring is around the corner and I'm busy tip tapping away on my keyboard trying to improve my website.

## What I'm Doing To Improve My Websites Titles
I've been doing a lot of research on the way people read information. One thing I've learned is that the majority of people don't read everything on the page. 

What most people do when they look at a page is scan the page looking for words and information.

Titles should be descriptive but not too long. Under 200 Characters seems to be the guideline.
