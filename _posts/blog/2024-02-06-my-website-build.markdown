I've written a couple of blogs about what I'm up too but I have not really gotten around to describing exactly what I'm doing.

One of my goals for this year is to be more expressive and explain my thought process as a web designer.

To start off I'm building my website out with Jekyll.  If you don't know what Jekyll is it's a static site generator that provides some pretty useful tools and features to build out a website.
