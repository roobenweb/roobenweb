I've written a couple of blogs about what I'm up too but I have not really gotten around to describing exactly what I'm doing.

One of my goals for this year is to be more expressive and explain my thought process as a web designer.

To start, I'm building my website out with Jekyll.  Jekyll is a static site generator that provides some pretty useful tools and features to build out websites.

One of the reasons I prefer Jekyll over WordPress is because Jekyll is lighter and more simple.
