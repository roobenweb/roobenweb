This week I've been working a lot on new website designs. 

To help out other designers and to get some traffic to my website I've decided to publish them to my Figma community profile as FREE design resources.

So far it's been working pretty well. I've also been using website likes Behance and Dribbble to advertise them and so far I've gotten about 100 people to Duplicate them.

Here is the design that I finished Today.
