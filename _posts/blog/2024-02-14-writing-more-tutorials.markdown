A new day means a new opportunities. Today I want to turn my attention and add more content to a page I've already been working on. 
 
## Creating Some Pages For Local SEO
Earlier this week I had written some local content for my website. Today I ended up adding more content to the page to improve it's ranking.  Overall I added a couple hundred words and restructured the writing. Check it out here, <a href="/brea-california/get-website-$199/" target="_blank">Get a Website in Brea for Just $199</a>.

## Writing A Tutorial on Getting Your Website On Google
Another thing I thought I'd start today was writing something a little more informative rather than hacking my services in local SEO.
I wanted to create a piece of content that a lot of people could benefit from so I decided to write an article about <a href="/websites/tutorials/search-engine-optimization/" target=")blank">How To Get Your Website Listed In Google's Search Results</a>

<a href="/blog/get-website-$199/" target="_blank">Online Shoe Store Website Design</a>.
