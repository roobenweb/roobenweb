For the last couple of weeks I've been working on project. The project is a free <a href="/projects/" target="_blank"> landing page template</a>  I'll be using.

It's a front end project so I'll be building it with the basics.

## Some of the Features on This Landing Page Include
Below are some of the features I decided add to the landing page

- Carousel Animation
- Easily customizable icon section
- Formspree Contact Section


### New Focus
I spent some time thinking of what I'm going to be doing next.

I think I'm going to be making an interactive calculator app.

I got the idea from watching AI content explode in popularity in the past
couple of years.
