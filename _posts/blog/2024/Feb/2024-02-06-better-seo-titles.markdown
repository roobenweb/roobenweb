It's March, spring is around the corner and I'm busy tapping away trying to improve my website.  

## Researching the way people research
I've been doing a lot of research on the way people read information online and I've learned a few interested things about it.

One thing I've learned is that the majority of people online don't read everything on the page. 

## Most People Scan Before They Read
What most people do when they look at a web page is scan the page with the goal of finding words pertaining to what they're researching.


This leads me to my next piece of advice when you're writing headlines for your websites content.

Titles should be descriptive but not too long. Under 200 Characters seems to be the guideline.
