This week I've been working a lot on new designs. 

After making them in Figma I publish them to my community profile on figma as free design resources. 

To geth them out there for people to use I've been posting them on Behnace, Figma, and Twitter. 

So far it's been working pretty well, I've gooten about a hundred duplications and I've been using the traffic to boost my websites SEO ranking.
