This is a birthday invitation card design I made in Figma, feel free to duplicate it! I hope this helps you and that you learn something new.

## Why I Made This Birthday Invitation Card Design
I got the idea to make this design from a spam email. Since most of the people who are duplicating this are designer some of which who are just starting off I'd thought I'd write a little bit about this situation. When you're first starting off as a designer you'll get a lot of junk emails from scammers that are looking to take advantage of you. It usually starts out seemingly normal, you end up trading a few emails back and forth, agree to some design work, and towards the end they'll make up some elaborate lie to try and get you to send them some money they'll most likely disappear with. Before you start to laugh at me I understand how these scams work because I used to receive these types of emails years ago when I first started designing and did my proper research.

The reason I decided to engage with the scammer was because I was burnt out! I had spent about two and a half weeks working long hours everyday building out my website and creating free design resources. When I received this email I was trying to make a new design but the more I tried the more I became frustrated, I had nothin left in the tank. I didn't know what to do so I did what any sane person would and I began to take direction from a scammer. My hope was that by taking directions from someone else It would help me break the mental loop that was keeping me from making something new and it worked.

My advice to you is that if it seems to good to be true it probably is. I normally don't like to judge people that hard but if the fact that you're emailing a person who has an American sounding name but has a hard time formulating cohesive English sentences doesn't raise a red flag, then I don't know what to tell you. Another thing to keep in mind is revisions. I understand that not all design clients are super picky but if you don't get asked to make at least a couple edits to your work and everything is appearing to go smooth it's probably time to start asking some hard questions.

The more information I exchanged with this person the funnier the situation became. At some point the whole story and reason for the work was just too funny not laugh.
