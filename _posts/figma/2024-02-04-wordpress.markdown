This is a WordPress pricing table design that I made to advertise WordPress website services. My aim with this design was to help ordinary people who don't know a whole lot websites visualize these types of services as a more off the shelf product rather than some complicated topic.

What I've noticed is that their's a ton of people out there who want to start a website but the moment they go look into one they're bombarded with a ton of offers filled with jargon keywords that just don't make a whole lot of sense to them. This usually causes them to just keep day dreaming about the idea and eventually they push it to the back of their mind.

My goal was to simplify the whole process for them and include some of the main features and benefits. 

Each tier has different features and different price points.
