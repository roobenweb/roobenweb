This is a WordPress pricing  table design that I made to advertise WordPress website services on my website.

One of the reasons I made this pricing table design was to help visualize web design services for people who interested in acquiring a website but don't know how to go about getting one set up.

Keywords: WordPress, Website Design, Pricing Table, $299, Affordable Websites,
